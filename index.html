<h2>A Message from Sandip Kumar Tiwari, Son of Our Founder</h2>

<p>
  <i>My father, Ganga Sagar Tiwari, started The Tiwari’s Dine-In with a simple dream—to serve food that felt like home. He believed that a great meal wasn’t just about taste but about the warmth and love that went into making it. Though he is no longer with us, his spirit lives on in every dish we serve and every guest we welcome.

For nearly three decades, we have carried forward his legacy, staying true to his time-honored recipes and commitment to quality. Every bite you take is a tribute to the passion he poured into this place. Whether you’re here for a quick meal or a long conversation over good food, we are honored to have you as part of our extended family.

So, sit back, enjoy the flavors, and know that at The Tiwari’s Dine-In, you’re not just a guest—you’re part of our story."</i>
